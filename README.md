This is a quick shopping list app I built in Flutter. It currently stores a single task list in your device's local user app data, as JSON encoded strings, though it is set up to use a temporary Firebase back-end as well.

It is currently set up to run with Flutter 3.24.5, and is updated to all the latest packages as of November 25, 2024. It also is warning fixed under the latest flutter_lints 5.0.0 best code practices package.
