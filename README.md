This is a quick shopping list app I built in Flutter. It currently stores a single task list in your device's local user app data, as JSON encoded strings, 
though it is set up to use a temporary Firebase back-end as well.

This app is still a work in progress, and currently broken due to some recent changes to a third-party package... I'm working on it!

It is currently planned to be set up to run with Flutter 3.25.4, and is updated to all the latest packages as of September 18, 2025. It also is warning fixed 
under the latest flutter_lints 6.0.0 best code practices package.

To play with this, you will need to create a new Flutter project, and then copy these files over the existing boilerplate files.
